Auto Retail: How are iBuyers Affecting the Market? Applying Data Science Tools to Understanding Changes in the U.S. Auto Retail &amp; Advertising Market Josh Grasso | joshgrasso@gmail.com This project seeks to provide a framework with which to answer questions that center around the key debate in the U.S. Auto Retail and Auto Advertising markets: how is the market changing with the presence of new-entrants. The data used in this analysis is produced internally through web scraping of auto inventory marketplaces: Cars.com and TrueCar as well as traditional, publicly listed dealer networks: Sonic and Lithia.  The two main questions answered in this analysis are:  Are the new-entrants into auto retailing (the iBuyers) increasing the market size of auto advertising? Are dealer inventory volumes and/or advertising intensity changing (declining) due to the new-entrant?
